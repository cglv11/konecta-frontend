# Konecta Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Konecta project, built with React and served using Nginx. The project is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in any environment.

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the key files in this project:

- **Dockerfile**: Contains the instructions for building the Docker image for the frontend.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration for running the frontend service.
- **nginx.conf**: Custom Nginx configuration to serve the React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Docker Network

Before running the frontend service, ensure that the Docker network `konecta_network` is created:

```bash
docker network create konecta_network
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image for the frontend service:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

This command will execute the instructions in the `Dockerfile` to build the React application and prepare it for deployment using Nginx.

## Running the Project

To start the frontend service, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the frontend service in detached mode (`-d`), meaning it will run in the background.

You can now access the frontend application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Stopping the Project

To stop the frontend service, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the container.

## Docker Compose Commands

Here are some useful Docker Compose commands:

- **Build the Docker image**: `docker-compose build`
- **Start the service**: `docker-compose up -d`
- **Stop the service**: `docker-compose down`
- **View logs**: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Custom Nginx Configuration

The `nginx.conf` file included in this project is used to configure how Nginx serves the React application. If you need to customize the Nginx configuration, you can edit the `nginx.conf` file and rebuild the Docker image.

### Example `nginx.conf`:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  
  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html/;
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Nginx to serve the static files generated by the React build process and handle client-side routing.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the `konecta_network` Docker network is shared with other services like the backend and database if necessary.
- If you make changes to the React application, rebuild the Docker image using `docker-compose build` and restart the service.
